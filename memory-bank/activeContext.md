# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Enhancing the AI model seeding pipeline based on SOLID principles
- Improving implementations of extractors, particularly the OllamaExtractor
- Testing and refining the end-to-end pipeline workflow
- Addressing edge cases and error handling in pipeline components

## Recent Changes
- Implemented interfaces for all pipeline components in `interfaces.py`
- Created concrete implementations for extractors (Ollama, JSON)
- Built the pipeline orchestrator with phase-specific execution logic
- Implemented factory pattern for component creation and configuration
- Established dependency injection for component wiring
- Developed logging system integrated across all components

## Next Steps
- Complete and test the OllamaExtractor implementation
- Enhance error handling and reporting in pipeline phases
- Improve validation of input/output data between pipeline phases
- Add unit tests for individual components
- Create CLI script for simplified end-user interaction with pipeline
- Implement more comprehensive data validation and normalization

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using template method pattern in base component classes
- Ensuring loose coupling between pipeline phases
- Improving traceability and debugging through structured logging
- Maintaining flexibility for new model sources and formats
- Balancing abstraction with practical implementation needs
