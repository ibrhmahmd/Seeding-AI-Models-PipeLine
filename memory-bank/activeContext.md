# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Establishing the Memory Bank documentation system for project continuity
- Ensuring all core context files are present and up to date

## Recent Changes
- Initialized memory-bank directory and created projectbrief.md
- Drafted initial context files (productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)

## Next Steps
- Complete the rest of the core memory bank files (progress.md)
- Review and update documentation as project evolves
- Integrate memory bank updates into regular workflow

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation-first approach for project continuity
- Prioritize clarity and extensibility in all scripts and data files
