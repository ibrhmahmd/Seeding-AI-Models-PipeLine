# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Refactoring the AI model seeding pipeline to follow SOLID principles
- Redesigning the system architecture for better modularity and extensibility
- Creating a well-defined folder structure and component design
- Implementing a phased approach to transform the current scripts into a robust pipeline system

## Recent Changes
- Created detailed SOLID Principles Application Plan document
- Designed new folder structure and system architecture based on SOLID principles
- Defined explicit step-by-step system design for all pipeline phases
- Mapped out interfaces and class hierarchies for each component
- Outlined the pipeline orchestration approach with dependency injection

## Next Steps
- Define interfaces/abstract base classes for each pipeline phase
- Refactor each script into a class/module implementing the relevant interface
- Create a pipeline orchestrator for end-to-end workflow management
- Update CLI scripts to use the new orchestrator
- Write tests for each component using mocks for dependencies

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation-first approach for project continuity
- Using dependency injection to facilitate testing and component swapping
- Focusing on clear interfaces and abstractions to enable future extensions
- Maintaining traceability and logging throughout all pipeline phases
