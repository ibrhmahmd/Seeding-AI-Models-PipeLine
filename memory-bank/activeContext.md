# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- End-to-end testing and validation of the AI model seeding pipeline
- Ensuring all pipeline phases (extraction, enrichment, tag mapping, remapping, seeding, reporting/cleanup) are robust and traceable
- Improving validation and archiving logic in scripts

## Recent Changes
- Completed full pipeline test using PipeLineTestingPlan.md
- Fixed mapping logic to enforce all validation rules (length, URL, required fields, etc.)
- Fixed seeding script to use mapped payloads and archive successfully seeded files
- Added placeholder URL logic for referenceLink to resolve API 400 errors
- Confirmed 9/10 models seeded successfully; 1 failed due to server error

## Next Steps
- Automate archiving for already-seeded files or add manual/utility script for this
- Investigate and resolve the single model/server error (if needed)
- Continue to expand data extraction and normalization for new sources
- Further improve error handling and reporting in all scripts

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation-first approach for project continuity
- Prioritize clarity, extensibility, and traceability in all scripts and data files
- Validation and compliance with backend API is now enforced in mapping logic
