# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- Python (primary scripting language)
- JSON (data storage and interchange)
- Command-line interface (for running scripts)

## Development Setup
- Scripts are run from the command line (Windows, but should be cross-platform)
- Directory structure: scripts and data files organized for clarity
- No external database required for core workflows (file-based)

## Technical Constraints
- Scripts should be cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Data files must remain human-readable and versionable
- Minimal external dependencies (prefer standard library)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- (Optional) Additional Python packages for advanced data processing (to be documented as needed)
