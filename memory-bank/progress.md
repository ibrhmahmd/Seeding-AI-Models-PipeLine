# Progress

## What Works
- SOLID-based architecture with interfaces and implementations
- Component factory pattern for dynamic component creation
- Pipeline orchestrator for coordinating workflow phases
- Dependency injection for component wiring and testing
- Implementations for multiple extractors (Ollama, JSON)
- Robust logging system throughout all components
- Abstract base classes providing common functionality
- Template method pattern for phase-specific implementations
- End-to-end pipeline flow from extraction to archiving

## What's Left to Build
- Complete all implementations of the OllamaExtractor
- Expand test coverage for all components
- CLI script for user-friendly pipeline execution
- Enhanced error handling and reporting
- More robust data validation between pipeline phases
- Advanced data normalization strategies

## Current Status
- Core infrastructure (interfaces, base classes) is complete
- Factory and pipeline orchestrator are fully implemented
- Most pipeline components have working implementations
- SOLID principles have been successfully applied
- Memory Bank documentation is up-to-date
- Implementation of individual components is in progress

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases in data extraction may not be handled
- Validation between pipeline phases could be more robust
- Error handling needs enhancement in some components
- Missing comprehensive tests for all components
- API integration needs additional security considerations
- Documentation for advanced configuration scenarios
