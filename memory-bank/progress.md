# Progress

## What Works
- Initial set of scripts for extracting, sorting, and mapping model data
- JSON data files for various model sources (Ollama, Devstral, etc.)
- Logging of seeding operations

## What's Left to Build
- Expand data extraction to additional model sources
- Enhance data normalization and validation
- Automate more of the seeding and update workflows
- Improve documentation and error handling

## Current Status
- Core scripts and data files are functional
- Memory Bank documentation is being established

## Known Issues
- Manual steps still required for some data sources
- Data format inconsistencies between sources
- Limited automation for ongoing updates
