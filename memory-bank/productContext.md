# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The rapid growth of open-source and proprietary AI models has created a fragmented landscape of model metadata, formats, and sources. This project aims to unify, normalize, and make accessible the metadata and entities for a wide range of AI models, enabling easier integration, discovery, and use.

## Problems It Solves
- Disparate and inconsistent model metadata across sources
- Manual, error-prone data collection and transformation
- Difficulty in seeding and updating databases with new models/entities
- Lack of traceability and documentation for model data

## How It Should Work
- Automated scripts extract, transform, and normalize model/entity data from multiple sources
- Data is stored in a consistent, extensible format (e.g., JSON)
- Easy-to-use workflows for updating, sorting, and seeding data
- Clear documentation and logging for all data operations

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, script-driven workflows for technical users
- High data quality and reliability
- Extensible to new sources and formats
- Transparent and well-documented processes
