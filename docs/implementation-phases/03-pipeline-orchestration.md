# Phase 3: Pipeline Orchestration

## Objectives
- Create a pipeline orchestrator to coordinate components
- Implement dependency injection for loose coupling
- Establish data flow between components

## Tasks

### 1. Pipeline Interface
- [ ] Define `IPipeline` interface in `interfaces.py`
- [ ] Specify methods for pipeline configuration and execution
- [ ] Define pipeline events and lifecycle hooks

### 2. Pipeline Implementation
- [ ] Create `pipeline.py` with:
  - [ ] `Pipeline` class implementing `IPipeline`
  - [ ] Component registration and wiring
  - [ ] Sequential execution logic
  - [ ] Error propagation strategy

### 3. Dependency Injection Container
- [ ] Implement component registration mechanism
- [ ] Create factory methods for component instantiation
- [ ] Support configuration-based component selection
- [ ] Allow runtime swapping of components

### 4. Pipeline Configuration
- [ ] Define pipeline configuration schema
- [ ] Implement configuration validation
- [ ] Add support for different pipeline variants (full, partial)
- [ ] Allow component-specific configuration

### 5. Data Flow Management
- [ ] Implement data passing between components
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of component outputs
- [ ] Maintain data integrity throughout the pipeline
- [ ] Add state tracking for pipeline execution

### 6. Error Management
- [ ] Implement pipeline-level error handling
- [ ] Add recovery strategies for common failures
- [ ] Support graceful termination and resumption
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive error logging

## Expected Outcomes
- Functional pipeline orchestrator
- Components properly integrated via dependency injection
- Clear data flow between pipeline phases
- Robust error handling at the pipeline level
- Support for different pipeline configurations

## Next Phase
After completing the pipeline orchestration, proceed to Phase 4: CLI Scripts & Integration.
