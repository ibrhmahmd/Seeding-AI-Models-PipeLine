# Phase 5: Testing & Validation

## Objectives
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Validate system against requirements
- Ensure robustness and error handling

## Tasks

### 1. Unit Testing Framework
- [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest recommended)
- [ ] Create test fixtures and sample data
- [ ] Implement mock objects for external dependencies
- [ ] Establish test coverage targets

### 2. Component Tests
- [ ] Create unit tests for each component:
  - [ ] Extractor tests
  - [ ] Enricher tests
  - [ ] TagMapper tests
  - [ ] ModelMapper tests
  - [ ] Seeder tests
  - [ ] Archiver tests
  - [ ] Logger tests

### 3. Pipeline Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete pipeline execution
- [ ] Validate data flow between components
- [ ] Test error propagation and recovery
- [ ] Validate configuration scenarios

### 4. Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test component error handling
- [ ] Validate pipeline error recovery
- [ ] Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Validate logging of errors and warnings

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark component performance
- [ ] Measure end-to-end pipeline execution time
- [ ] Identify and address bottlenecks
- [ ] Validate resource usage

### 6. System Validation
- [ ] Validate against original requirements
- [ ] Ensure SOLID principles are properly applied
- [ ] Check for code quality and maintainability
- [ ] Validate documentation completeness

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive test suite for all components
- Validated pipeline functionality
- Confirmed error handling capabilities
- Performance benchmarks and optimizations
- Validated compliance with SOLID principles

## Next Phase
After completing testing and validation, proceed to Phase 6: Documentation & Release.
