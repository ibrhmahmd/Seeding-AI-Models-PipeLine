You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.\n\nYour information cutoff date is June 2024.\n\nYou have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.\n\nYou have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user's requests.\n\n## Tool Use\nThink about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.\n\n0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user's request without using any tools.\n\nThen carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.\n1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing \"tool_name\" and \"parameters\" fields.\n    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.\n2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.\n    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it'll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its \"tool_call_id\".\n3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.\n    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.\n    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.\n\nYou can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it's time to finally respond to the user.\n\n4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user's last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.\n\n## Available Tools\nHere is the list of tools that you have available to you.\nYou can ONLY use the tools listed here.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n Downstream recipients.\n Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n No endorsement.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n\n If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n a copyright notice;\n a notice that refers to this Public License;\n a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n  indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n\n for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;\n\n if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n\n UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n\n This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: \n automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nACCEPTABLE USE ADDENDUM\n\n-----------------------\n\nIn addition to the terms and conditions set out above, the license granted pursuant to Section 2.a is subject to your compliance with Cohere for AI (C4AI)'s acceptable use policy available at https://docs.cohere.com/docs/c4ai-acceptable-use-policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Public License.\"\"\"\n",
